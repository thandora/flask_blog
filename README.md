# Test Blog

A simple web app implementing RESTful API.  
Features:

- User creations
- User login/logout
- Authentication
- CRUD operations
- Article viewing, creation, edit, delete
- Article comments

## Objective

This is unhosted and some best practices are not followed (like the blatant admin email hardcoded). This is for showcase only.
